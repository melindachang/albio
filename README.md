> Astronomy utility infrastructure for JavaScript

Albio is an [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy)-esque framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools for JavaScript development in astronomy and astrophysics. It consists of the following:

- A compact central library that delivers basic functionality for less demanding projects

- Package infrastructure that builds upon the `albio` core to promote a robust, interoperable ecosystem of affiliated tools

This project is still under heavy development and is not ready for real use.
